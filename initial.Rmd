## Dig to kill work

#about 37% of our hits come off of a dig (when the other team attacks the ball, including setter dumps). 747 counted digs. 

vb %>%
  group_by(dig) %>%
  filter(hit=="kill") %>%
  summarise(kill.count=n())

vb %>%
  group_by(dig) %>%
  filter(hit=="attempt") %>%
  summarise(att.count=n())

vb %>%
  group_by(dig) %>%
  filter(hit=="error") %>%
  summarise(err.count=n())

#Given that a ball was dug, based off of these stats, 15% chance it will be an error. 52% chance it will be an attempt. 32% it will be a kill. Compare this to when a ball is not dug: 18% chance it will be an error. 45% chance it will be an attempt. 37% chance it will be a kill. Not too far off?

# try to see if there is a threshold (when we win, what is our dig to kill?)
